/*
*   Problem: Tracking an Unknown Quantity of Student Records
*
*   In this problem, you will write a class with methods to store and
*   manipulate a collection of student records. A student record contains
*   a student number and a grade, both integers, and a string for the student
*   name. The following functions are to be implemented:
*
*   addRecord - This method takes a student number, name, and grade and adds
*   a new record with this data to the collection.
*
*   recordWithNumber - This function takes a student number and retrieves the
*   record with that student number from the collection.
*
*   removeRecord - This function takes a student number and removes the record
*   with that student number from the collection.
*
*   The collection can be of any size. The addRecord operation is expected to
*   be called frequently, so it must be implemented efficiently.
